# Codeforces Solutions Archive

An automatically curated, self-organizing archive of my Codeforces solutions.

Every day, `auto_push.py` scans my local competitive-programming folder, identifies
newly solved problems (via CPH metadata + the Codeforces API), renames and files
them into rating-based folders, and pushes exactly a fixed number of new solutions
to this repository — fully unattended.

> ⚠️ Everything between the `AUTO-GENERATED` markers below is rewritten by the
> script on every run. Do not edit that section by hand — edits will be
> overwritten on the next push. Everything above/outside those markers is safe
> to edit freely.

Files are named `{contestId}{index} - {Problem Name}.cpp`, e.g.
`1857A - Array Coloring.cpp`, and sorted into a folder named after the
problem's Codeforces rating (or `Unrated/` if the problem has no rating).

## Setup & Automation

See [`SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md`](SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md) for:

- Installing dependencies
- Configuring `config.json`
- Running the script manually / in dry-run mode
- Scheduling it to run automatically every day at **10:00 PM** via
  **Windows Task Scheduler** (recommended) or the Python `schedule` library
  (optional alternative)
